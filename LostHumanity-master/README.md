Aoi and Hatoko were peacefully roaming around their hometown, but suddenly someone was trying to turn it into ruins. As they kept on running towards a safe place, they encountered a cat. Little do they know, the cat was actually a witch with an immense ammount of powers. As they have met each other's eyes, the cat suddenly took Hatoko's soul, leaving Aoi behind. With strong dedication and loyalty, Aoi tried to save Hatoko but the witch decided to challenge him if that was his resolve. The challenge was to clear a certain dungeon and find her. Aoi was transported to the tower through the portal casted by the witch. Will Aoi accept his resolve to enter and save his dear Hatoko in the dangerous tower of the cat witch?
