Design Analysis of Algorithms


## Lab Activities

**1. Sorting Algorithms Comparison**

  - Implemented Selection Sort, Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort
  - Compared the running times of Selection Sort, Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort in varying input sizes using Performance.now()
  
**2. Dynamic Programming**

  - Implemented Fibonacci Series Using:
  
    - Recursion
    - Recursion with Memoization
    - Iterative Method
    
  - Implemented Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) using Bottom-Up Approach
  
## Long Exam

**1. Sorting Algorithms Comparison**

  - Implemented Selectin Sort, Radix Sort and Merge Sort
  - Compared the running times of Selection Sort, Radix Sort and Merge Sort in varying input sizes and cases using Performance.now()

## Final Project

**1. 0/1 Knapsack Problem**
  
  - Implemented the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Programming Approach
