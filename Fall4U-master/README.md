## Fall 4 U - A game of loyalty, dedication and perseverance

1. **Loyalty:** Catch only the falling hearts, avoid the temptations! 

2. **Dedication:** As a challenger, your main goal is to gather as many falling hearts as you can, while avoiding the other falling objects. 

3. **Perseverance**: The longer you are in the battlefield, the stronger the temptations will be. 

```
How long can you survive the trial of love?
